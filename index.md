This lesson is an introduction to anonymization of data using Python 3 and [Arx-Data Anonymization Tool][Arx-software] (Arx). The lessons assume you have prior knownledge of Python 3 but you don't need prior knowledge of Arx. This lesson references [JupyterLab][jupyterlab] but can be taught using alternative Python 3 interpreters
as well (e.g., repl.it, Anaconda).
