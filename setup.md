For more advanced anonymization, we will use Arx-Data Anonymization Tool.Arx software was chosen because it is free and open-sourced. It is licensed under the [Apache LICENSE-2.0][Apache LICENSE-2.0]. It further uses external libraries, which have licenses that can be seen inside their respective folders.
